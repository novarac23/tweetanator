## Tweetanator

If you ever wondered if your tweets are "good vibes" only or if they have some
negativity in them look no further!

Tweetenator can help you with that.

This project uses machine learning to figure out what's the sentiment in a given
piece of text. Right now it can only figure out positive or negative but with
proper training it can figure out way more then that. 

Accuracy is not amazing but it's also not horrible, it's right around 70%. 
It could definitely be tweaked to get closer to 90% but for now it's not that bad.

As far as where I found my dataset for training this ML model here's the link: http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students
